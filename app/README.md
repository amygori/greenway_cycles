Greenway Cycling
====================

This fork of a collaborative weekend project for The Iron Yard Academy's Front End Engineering course is a refactoring of a single-page website for a fictitious local business. 

The layout and the animated logo in the header were designed by [Tyler Berry](http://tylerberry.us/).  

Run gulp to build, and gulp serve to deploy locally.
